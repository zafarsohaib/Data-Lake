# Project: Data Lake with Spark

### Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### Project Description

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Project Datasets

You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

-   Song data:  `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
-   Log data:  `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

## Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the  [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

```

## Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Project Template



The project template includes three files:

-   `etl.py`  reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3
-   `dl.cfg`contains your AWS credentials
-   `README.md`  provides discussion on your process and decisions

## How to run

For Spark local mode:
1.  Modify input and output data paths in etl.py main function, if needed
2.  Run python script etl.py


For running Spark application on AWS EMR:

1. Create an IAM User on AWS, and assign roles to access EMR Cluster and S3 Storage.
2. Create EC2 Key-Pair key.
3. Replace AWS IAM Credentials in *dl.cfg* config file.
4. Upload the dl.cfg and etl.py files to your S3 Bucket in the same region where you will create the EMR cluster.
5. Create EMR Cluster with Spark and Hadoop, using the key created in step 2.
6. Check the security group settings of the Master Node, the inboud rule should allow the SSH connection.
7. Using PuTTY remotely login to the EMR Master node, with the EMR Key pair.
8. Copy the *dl.cfg* and *etl.py* from your S3 bucket to the current directory of EMR Master Node, using the following command:
```
>> aws s3 cp "s3://bucket_name/etl.py" .
>> aws s3 cp "s3://bucket_name/dl.cfg" .
```
9. Submit the Spark Job using the following command:
````
>> spark-submit etl.py
```` 
Additional spark configuration parameters can also be set with *spark-submit* (optional)
 9. After the Spark Job is successfully finished, check if the parquet files are successully created in the S3 output bucket (mentioned in the etl.py)
 10. Read the parquet files and perform the analytics queries.  


## Example Analytics Queries


Reading output parquet files using *spark*:
```
users = spark.read.parquet("output/users/*.parquet")
songs= spark.read.parquet("output/songs/*.parquet")
artists= spark.read.parquet("output/artists/*.parquet")
time= spark.read.parquet("output/time/*/*/*.parquet")
songplay = spark.read.parquet("output/songplay/*/*/*.parquet")
```
Following query will give the list of user names who listened to a particular song *(for example, "Setanta matins")*:
```
df = songplay.join(users, on=['user_id'], how='inner').join(songs, on=['song_id'], how='inner')
df.select(["first_name", "last_name"]).where(df.title=='Setanta matins').show()
````
A query to find the list of 10 paid members of *Sparkify* app, sorted by first name would be:
````
users.select(["first_name", "last_name"]).where(users.level=='paid').orderBy(users.first_name).limit(10).show()
````

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

The star schema includes the following tables, stored as parqued files.


#### Fact Table

1.  **songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_
```
root
 |-- start_time: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- user_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- level: string (nullable = true)
 |-- song_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- session_id: long (nullable = true)
 |-- location: string (nullable = true)
 |-- user_agent: string (nullable = true)
 |-- songplay_id: long (nullable = false)
```
Partitioned by *(pk_year, pk_month)* 

**Note:** *songplay_id* is filled using function *monotonically_increasing_id()*, which is never nullable.

#### Dimension Tables

2.  **users**  - users in the app
    -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
```
root
 |-- user_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- first_name: string (nullable = true)
 |-- last_name: string (nullable = true)
 |-- gender: string (nullable = true)
 |-- level: string (nullable = true)
 ```
3.  **songs**  - songs in music database
    -   _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
```
root
 |-- song_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- title: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- year: long (nullable = true)
 |-- duration: double (nullable = true)
 ```
4.  **artists**  - artists in music database
    -   _artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude_
```
root
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- name: string (nullable = true)
 |-- location: string (nullable = true)
 |-- latitude: double (nullable = true)
 |-- longitude: double (nullable = true)
 ```

5.  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_
 ```
 root
 |-- start_time: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- hour: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- day: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- week: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- month: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- year: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- weekday: integer (nullable = true)
 ```
 *Partitioned by (pk_year, pk_month)*
 
 **Note:** 
The columns (keys) used for partitioning are not part of the parquet files when they are read for analytics purposes later. Thats why, two additional columns (keys) were created for partitioning the parquet files, namely *(pk_year, pk_month)*

## How to Partion Parquet File 

Partitions create a subdirectory for each value of the partition field, so if you are filtering by that field, instead of reading every file it will read only the files in the appropiate subdirectory.

-   You should partition when your data is too large  **and**  you usually work with a subset of the data at a time.
    
-   You should partition by a field that you both need to filter by frequently  **and**  that has low cardinality, i.e: it will create a relatively small amount of directories with relatively big amount of data on each directory.
    

You don't want to partition by a unique id, for example. It would create lots of directories with only one row per directory; this is very inefficient the moment you need to select more than one id.

Some typical partition fields could be dates if you are working with time series (daily dumps of data for instance), geographies (country, branches,...) or taxonomies (types of object, manufacturer, etc).
